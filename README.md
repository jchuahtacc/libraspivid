# `libraspivid`

### Introduction

A collection of C++11 classes that implement Raspberry Pi Camera functionality. Much of the code has been adapted 
directly from [Raspberry Pi's `raspicam` implementation](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland/tree/master/host_applications/linux/apps/raspicam)
with some modifications.

### Features

- C++11 class wrappers for many Raspberry Pi Camera components
- Automatic component initialization/destruction
- Callback wrapper class for easy callback implementation

### Usage

The included `CMakeLists.txt` file exports the `raspivid` static library and a `${LIBRASPIVID_INCLUDE_DIRS}` environment variable.
You can setup a CMake project directory structure like this one:

```
/project_root
   CMakeLists.txt
   /libraspivid
   /src
      my_project.cpp   
```

Your CmakeLists.txt file should appear as follows:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(THREADS_PREFER_PTHREAD_FLAG ON)
project(libraspivid_example_project)
add_subdirectory(libraspivid)
include_directories(${LIBRASPIVID_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(my_project ./src/my_project.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_project raspivid)
```

Be sure that your `my_project.cpp` includes...

```C++
#include "RaspiVid.h"
using namespace raspivid
```
